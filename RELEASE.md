# Release

This is a release, with a starting point, to get you started with React & Vite.

If you need to disable _a11y_ linting rules, change `airbnb` to `airbnb-base` in `.eslintrc.json`

```json
"extends": [
  "airbnb-base",
  "airbnb-typescript",
  "plugin:react/jsx-runtime",
  "plugin:prettier/recommended",
  "prettier"
]
```
